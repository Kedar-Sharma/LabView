				JOYSTICK TESTING

The project aims at developing a system to verify the working of a four way electrical joystick. This project is developed using LabVIEW software.
The front panel consists of:
1) company, model name, model number of the joystick manufacturer.
2) A table containing serial number, controller number, location of controller, voltage output which must be entered by the operator testing the joystick.
3) The voltage output got from the controller must be displayed in form of X and Y axes.
4) a graph showing X and Y axes values.

The operator must take readings with different controllers and controller positions and record the respective X and Y voltage values.
Also the graph containing X and Y values must be verified with the desired results. If the voltage values do not match with the desired results then the joystick is faulty.
